### What is EdTechConf

EdTechConf is an organisation which aims to bring together like-minded schools, teachers and other interested parties for the purpose of equipping, inspiring and training teachers in the use of educational technology through local school-based workshops and seminars and an annual conference in Cape Town.


### Why partner with EdTechConf

EdTechConf welcomes the partnership of a school which wishes to host an EdTechConf event. We offer two types of events:
- EdTechConf Extended: Two day conferences, hosted by a school for the surrounding community.
- EdTechConf Thinkshops: Afternoon workshops focussing on a specific topic with input from an expert.

Partnering with EdTechConf offers several advantages, including:

- Access to leverage the EdTechConf brand, intellectual property and marketing materials
- Access to our network of speakers
- Guidance and advice in terms of hosting the event
- Support from EdTechConf's Social Media team in marketing the event

The EdTechConf team will give full support to the organisers in terms of promotion of the event, finding keynote speakers, social media engagement and use of the EdTechConf website.


### How to apply

Application to host an event (Extended or Thinkshop) should be made by sending an email to [events@edtechconf.co.za](events@edtechconf.co.za). This email should give detail regarding the proposed venue, expected number of participants, broad theme, and proposed dates. Not all applications to host an EdTechConf Extended will be granted as dates, geographical location and other factors will need to be considered.


### Guidelines

Please note the following when applying to host an EdTechConf Extended Event:

1. The event will need to be branded "EdTechConf Extended @ School Name". 

2. The ethos of EdTechConf would need to be prevalent at your event. This entails an interactive environment and an emphasis on giving delegates practical tools and ideas.

3. EdTechConf is for educators. Therefore, while vendors are welcome to attend EdTechConf events, they will not be permitted to exhibit their products or solicit business.

4. Sponsors who are approved by EdTechConf may be permitted to include their promotional material in delegate bags. This as long as they do not interfere with the spirit with which EdTechConf is run.

5. While the EdTechConf team need not be present at every planning meeting, organisers are expected to keep EdTechConf abreast of all decision taken by the local organising team. 

6. Mutually-agreed timeline for the key events in planning an Extended Conference.
