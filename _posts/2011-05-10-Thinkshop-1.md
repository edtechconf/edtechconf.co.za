<p class="well"><b>Eish, bit of bad news.</b><br>Thinkshop #1 - Legal Brief - has been postponed on account of speaker illness. While we are able to find a replacement we would prefer to wait for Nick to become available again as we consider him an expert in this field. Keep an eye on <a href="http://twitter.com/edtechconf">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://facebook.com/edtechconf">Facebook</a> and your email inbox for updates. We're getting in touch with delegates now.</p>

The information age has revolutionised the way we teach. 
As we give students access to a world of information, how do we take the necessary legal precautions to protect ourselves as school leaders and educators?

Join [Nicholas Hall](http://www.michalsons.co.za/nicholas-hall) and the EdTechConf team for the first Thinkshop. These micro-events focus on a particular issue and offer delegates access to experts on various topics in an interactive, small-group setting.

By the end of this Thinkshop you will have:
* Learned about the general legal issues around education technology in schools
* Learned how to write a valid Acceptable Use Policy
* Drafted your own Social Media Policy
* Networked with other school leaders and educators
