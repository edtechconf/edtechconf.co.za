The information age has revolutionised the way we teach. 
As we give students access to a world of information, how do we take the necessary legal precautions to protect ourselves as school leaders and educators?

Join [Nicholas Hall](http://www.michalsons.co.za/nicholas-hall) and the EdTechConf team for the first Thinkshop. These micro-events focus on a particular issue and offer delegates access to experts on various topics in an interactive, small-group setting.

By the end of this Thinkshop you will have:
* Learned about the general legal issues around education technology in schools
* Learned how to write a valid Acceptable Use Policy
* Drafted your own Social Media Policy
* Networked with other school leaders and educators
