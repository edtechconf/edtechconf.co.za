An afternoon of discussion and debate on tablet computers in education.

iPad this, Galaxy that â€“ these devices are rapidly making their way into our homes... and classrooms. Join us for our next Thinkshop all about tablets. 

The goal is to assist delegates in making an informed decision as to the usefulness of these devices in the classroom, what the differences between various brands are, and what they mean for the future of learning.
